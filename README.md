## Features

-   **Seamless integration with Obsidian:**
    -   Enjoy the convenience of accessing lightweight ChatGPT directly within Obsidian.
    -   You no longer have to worry about being interrupted in your creative process by leaving Obsidian to switch between software.
-   **User-friendly interface:**
    -   Interact with the ChatGPT API through an intuitive and straightforward lightweight design interface.
-   **Diverse ways to use:**

    -   You can quickly input the current document as a knowledge base into ChatGPT, and ask any questions about any content.
    -   You can also directly start a conversation with ChatGPT, quickly drafting and enriching your content, generating new ideas, or using the ChatGPT artificial intelligence to do anything you want.

-   **Flexible response handling:**
    -   Copy the AI-generated response to the clipboard. Alternatively, insert it directly at the cursor position in your current document, or at the end of the document.

## Configuration

You need to first set your own OpenAI API key in the Plugin Settings , so that the plugin can work properly.

1. Generate an OpenAI API key on the official website. [Click here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)
2. In Obsidian, go to `Settings`, click `Community Plugins` in the left menu , and enable `GPT-LiteInquirer` in the Installed Plugins.
3. Click the gear icon to enter the plugin settings. Then enter your API key in the `OpenAI API Key` field and then you're done! 🎉

## Usage

You can open the Lightweight ChatGPT Plugin interface in three ways:

-   By clicking on the Obsidian ribbon on the left.
-   By the Obsidian command `Open Lightweight Window`.
-   By manually set a keyboard shortcut for the command, such as `CTRL + K`.

In the GPT Lite Inquirer Window, the content you selected in the current Markdown document will be copied to the text box automatically. So you can use this text to ask questions or perform other operations, or directly write down anything you want to say.

Tips: You can also send content directly using the `CTRL + ENTER` shortcut.
